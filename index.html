<h2>A brief background on Travis</h2>
<section class="brief-background">
 
    <br/>

    <p class="bb-text">Jacques Bermon Webster II was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas. From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, "Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy sh*t. I saw mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherf*ckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey. I was always like, 'I gotta get the f*ck out this sh*t.' It made me who I am right now." Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business. Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer. Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen. During high school, he participated in musical theater. Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.</p>

<div class="card ye">
<img class="card-img" src="./assets/images/ye.jpg" alt="a picture of Kanye West"/>

<p> Not only did Kanye make graduation but he also serves as a mentor to Travis. He has provided him with tips on producing and provided him with connections within the music and fashion industries.</p>
</div>


<div class="card cudi">
<img class="card-img" src="./assets/images/cudi.jpg" alt="a picture of Kid Cudi"/>

<p> Kid Cudi was actually one of the sources inspiring his stage name, with Cudi's real name being Scott Mescudi. Travis also loves to mention how Cudi's Mr Rager has remedied his depression through dark times.  </p>
</div>


<div class="card pharrell">
<img class="card-img" src="./assets/images/pharrell.jpg" alt="a picture of Pharrell"/>

<p> Not much to say on Pharrell apart from Travis loving his BAPE contributions and producing style given the fact that Travis was more focused on being an upcoming producer than artist.</p>
